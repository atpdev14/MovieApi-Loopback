Description: A simple API to get information on movies and shows generated using Loopback. Several endpoints are automatically created through the Loopback scaffolding, but I have added some custom endpoints for added functionality and for proof of concept.  Loopback generates these endpoints using a method called remoteMethod().  Instances of these custom endpoints can be found in the common/models/movies-and-shows.js file.
